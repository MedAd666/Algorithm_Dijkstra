# Algorithm_Dijkstra


# Algorithm Explanation

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. The steps include:

Initialization:

- Set the distance to the start node as 0, and all other distances as infinity.
- Create a set of unsettled nodes containing all nodes.
  
Main Loop:

  - While there are unsettled nodes:
       Select the node with the lowest distance.
       Update the distances to its neighbors if a shorter path is found.
       Move the node to the settled set.

Result:
 - The shortest path and distance are calculated.

# Real-World Applications

Dijkstra's algorithm is extensively used in various real-world scenarios:

Network Routing:

  - Used in routers to find the shortest path for data packets.
  - Ensures efficient data transmission in computer networks.

Transportation Networks:

  - Optimizes route planning for vehicles, reducing travel time and fuel consumption.

Telecommunication Networks:

  - Determines the most efficient path for data transmission in telecommunication networks.

Robotics:

  - Applied in robotic path planning to navigate robots through environments with obstacles.
  
Geographical Information Systems (GIS):

  - Finds optimal routes in mapping applications, helping users reach destinations efficiently.
